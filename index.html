        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is John Doe, and I am a math grad student at Stanford University. I am interested in algebraic geometry and number theory.</p>
        <p>I have published several papers in top mathematics journals, and I am currently working on a new project on the arithmetic of elliptic curves.</p>
        <p>I am also passionate about teaching, and I have taught several courses at Stanford. I am always looking for new ways to make mathematics more accessible to students.</p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>My research interests lie in the intersection of algebraic geometry and number theory. I am particularly interested in the arithmetic of elliptic curves and abelian varieties.</p>
        <p>I am currently working on a new project on the arithmetic of elliptic curves over function fields. I am also interested in the application of algebraic geometry to cryptography and coding theory.</p>
